# This repo contains code bases and other resources for my portfolio.

This repo also contains all the html files which can be shared as github pages.
Please visit following links to access the pages to go through the deck.
1. __Retail Shelf Analytics__: https://naquibalam.github.io/Retail_Shelf_Analytics.html
2. __Toxic Comment Classification__: https://naquibalam.github.io/Toxic_Comment_Classification.html
3. __Covid Data Visualisation__: https://naquibalam.github.io/Covid_19_DataVisualization.html

__Note__: For https://naquibalam.github.io/Covid_19_DataVisualization.html, the code needs to rerun in order to update the stats and charts otherwise we will 
be seeing the older stats and charts.


I will keep adding new projects in my github pages going forward.
